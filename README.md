# Networking - Routing from the firewall to virtual machines through VLANs

During my internship at Akind, the objective was to make a web page hosted on a virtual Ubuntu Server, which was on VLAN 20, accessible from the ISP's IP address. This required configuring the Fortigate Firewall and Aruba Switch to allow traffic from the ISP's IP address to reach the Ubuntu Server on VLAN 20.

# CI/CD Pipeline 
### (Docker, Github Actions, Ansible, Terraform) 

In my thesis project at Akind and Academic Work, I developed a functional pipeline that retrieved ISS GPS data from an API and created my own API with a PostgreSQL database. To accomplish this, I leveraged tools like Terraform to manage infrastructure, Ansible for configuring and deploying the application, GitHub Actions for automating my CI/CD pipeline, along with Docker and Docker Hub for containerization and distribution. This pipeline empowered me to efficiently build and deploy my application with minimal manual intervention.

# AI - Computer Vision
The project leverages the YOLOv4 algorithm to detect and track speed cameras on Swedish roads, utilizing a dataset of over 2,000 annotated images. The algorithm is capable of detecting objects from a distance of 200 to 250 meters.

YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) is an advanced object detection algorithm that is both fast and accurate. It uses a single neural network to process the entire image and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly. YOLOv4 incorporates several improvements over its predecessors, including:

# Jetson Nano - OpenCV

An experiment using OpenCV (Computer Vision) involved training a server-controlled camera to follow an object. 

The setup included two servos for horizontal and vertical movement, controlled by a Python script utilizing the OpenCV library for object detection. The servos adjusted the camera's position based on the detected object's coordinates, ensuring continuous tracking. This project demonstrated effective integration of hardware and software for real-time object tracking using computer vision techniquesâ€‹
